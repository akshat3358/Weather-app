A weather app built using SwiftUI, that allows user to get the weather information like windspeed , sunset , sunrise , humidity and wind direction for a particular location and also hourly summary for the particular location and current day and it also show 5-day weather forecast for the particular location. 

We have used weather api here to get the weather data

### Design pattern

We have used MVVM pattern here to implement the Design.
